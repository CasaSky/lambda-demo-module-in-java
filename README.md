# Showcase of using terraform-modules project

This project demonstrates a showcase how to reuse terraform modules from the [GitHub](https://github.com/CasaSky/terraform-modules) repository terraform-modules as a source of a collection of managed modules

An example of a java lambda function and the lambda-sqs-sns module are used as demo to show how a deployment to aws can be done
